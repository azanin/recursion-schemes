If you call out B to A bird, it will answer calling bird x: *AB = x*

## Fond, normal and happy birds

There are several kinds of birds in the forest

+++

### Fond and normal bird

We say that **A is fond to B** when *AB = B*.

## Larks

A bird L is a Lark if *(Lx)y = x(yy)*

Lark is a very special bird, because its presence in the forest ensure that all the other birds are fond to at least another one. 

This is a wonderful effect, infact every bird are normal and happy as well!

+++
- Suppose there are a lark L and any x,y birds, so *(Lx)y = x(yy)*

- This is true for *y = Lx* as well, and so *(Lx)(Lx) = x((Lx)(Lx))*

- We can say then that **x is fond to (Lx)(Lx) and so normal as well**
